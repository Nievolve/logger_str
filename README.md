# Overview

This project is born of my love hate relationship with StrenghLog App.

I've used the app for gym training and it's very good. Resource rich and with easy to use tracking.
The negative is that lots of features are locked behind subscription, stuff I don't feel like needing to be. Like graphs and such.

That with my newly found data owning ideaology makes me want to try and develop an simular, simple app to track and advance my training

## Converter Project
Firstly I want to develop an pipeline to take exported data from my current training app and put it into my developed app.
